### Remove Nixos Derivation
To remove a derivation from the Nix store, you need to understand how Nix’s garbage collection (GC) mechanism works. The GC identifies store paths that are no longer reachable from any GC root and deletes them.

Identifying GC Roots
GC roots are directories or files that are referenced by the system or profiles. Common GC roots include:

/nix/var/nix/gcroots/auto: Automatically added GC roots for build results and profile generations.
/run/booted-system: The current system configuration.
/nix/var/nix/profiles: Profile directories.
/home/*: User profiles.
Removing Derivations
To remove a derivation, you need to:

#### Identify the GC root that references the derivation.
Remove the GC root or the indirect GC root (a symlink to a GC root).
Run nix-collect-garbage to trigger the garbage collector.
Example
Suppose you want to remove a derivation for the bsd-games package. First, find the GC root that references it:

nix-store -q --roots /nix/store/<derivation-path>

This command will show you the GC roots that reference the derivation. If the derivation is referenced by an indirect GC root (a symlink), you’ll need to remove that symlink.

Next, remove the GC root or the indirect GC root:

rm /nix/var/nix/gcroots/auto/<gc-root-symlink>

Finally, run nix-collect-garbage to trigger the garbage collector:

nix-collect-garbage

The garbage collector will delete the derivation and any other store paths that are no longer reachable from any GC root.

Additional Tips
To remove all old derivations and generations after an upgrade, you can manually delete the old generations and then run nix-collect-garbage.
Be cautious when removing GC roots, as this can affect the system’s configuration and profiles.
If you’re unsure about the impact of removing a derivation, you can use nix-store --gc --print-roots to inspect the GC roots and store paths before deleting anything.
Remember to always use caution when modifying the Nix store, as this can affect the system’s stability and functionality.
